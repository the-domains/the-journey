Vision
We're constantly experimenting with our worship. A little bit of this, a little bit of that.

1) Unusual competence in discernment or perception; intelligent foresight.
2) The manner in which one sees or conceives of something.
3) A mental image produced by the imagination.
The Journey is a worshiping community for college students that offers Presbyterians, non-Presbyterians, the spiritually curious, skeptics, and even Red Sox fans to grow spiritually while at college. We are open-minded, passionate, and committed to advancing the Gospel and glorifying God in our daily lives. Supported by a network of partner churches, a strong student leadership team creates regular opportunities to experience authentic Biblical community and participation in the Missio Dei ("Mission of God").
